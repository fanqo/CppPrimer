<h1> C++ Primer Errata</h1><em>Last modified 9 October 2012</em>
<p>
Every book has bugs in it, and 
<cite>C++ Primer</cite> is no exception. 
This page presents all the bugs that have come to our attention.
All of these errors will be corrected in the 
Second printing, October 2012.

Many thanks to the careful readers who notified us of these problems!
</p>
<h2>Technical errors corrected in the second printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Page 475:
The <tt>begin</tt> and <tt>end</tt> members of class
<tt>StrBlob</tt> should be defined outside the class body.
They can't be defined until class <tt>StrBlobPtr</tt>
is complete.
</li><li>Page 522:
The <tt>remove_from_Folders</tt> member correctly
removes pointers to itself from each of its 
corresponding <tt>Folder</tt>s, but it should
<tt>clear</tt> its own <tt>folders</tt> member as well.
</li><li>Pages 525–528:
The <tt>alloc</tt> member of <tt>StrVec</tt> should
be a static member of the class, not a data member
of each object.
To fix this error, add the <tt>static</tt>
keyword to the declaration of <tt>alloc</tt>
inside the <tt>StrVec</tt> class and provide
a definition of the form
<ol><tt>
allocator&lt;string&gt; StrVec::alloc;
</tt></ol>
inside the implementation file for <tt>StrVec</tt>.
</li><li>Page 567:
In the <tt>StrBlobPtr::operator--()</tt> function,
the call to check should pass <tt>curr</tt> as the first
argument, not <tt>-1</tt>.
</li><li>Page 762:
The
<tt>EOF</tt> preprocessor variable is defined
in the <tt>cstdio</tt> header not <tt>iostream</tt>.
</li></ul>

<h2>Clarifications and improvements made in the second printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Page 175:
The <tt>scores</tt> <tt>vector</tt> should be defined as 
<tt>const</tt> because we do not want the elements
in <tt>scores</tt> to be changed.
</li><li> Pages 576–578:
The <tt>div</tt> class reuses the
name of a C library function.
C++ compilers are permitted to put C library names
into the global namespace.
To avoid potential conflicts 
rename this class <tt>divide</tt>.
</li><li> Page 780:
Drop 
"are equivalent"
from the last sentence
of the highlighted box titled <em>Backward Compatibility:
Exception Specifications</em>.
These declarations both say that <tt>recoup</tt> won't throw, but there
are subtle distinctions between what the compiler is permitted to do
with these declarations.
</li></ul>

<h2>Typographical errors corrected in the second printing</h2>
<ul>
<li> Pages xxvi and 22 the correct web address for the
book code is <a href="http://www.informit.com/title/0321714113">http://www.informit.com/title/0321714113</a>
</li><li> Page 155:
The explanation of why we use an <tt>unsigned</tt> <tt>long</tt>
rather than an <tt>int</tt> 
should say that we need "at least 27" bits, not
that we need "at least 17" bits.
</li><li>Page 158: The last sentence before the exercises for <tt>4.10</tt>
should say that we 
"reset the current element" not the "next element".
</li><li>Page 177:
The second comment in the first two code examples should 
include <tt>7</tt> as a grade that will get a minus.
</li><li> Page 225: In the third sentence before the <i>Tip</i>
box, should read "<tt>string</tt> named <tt>ret</tt>"
not  "<tt>string</tt> named <tt>s</tt>".
</li><li>Page 229:
The type alias declaration in the code example at the top of the page 
should define <tt>arrT</tt> not <tt>arrtT</tt> and the
last comment in that example should
say that "<tt>func</tt> returns a pointer 
to an array of ten <tt>int</tt>s" not five <tt>int</tt>s.
</li><li> Page 236: Last sentence before the last code example
should be 
"For example,
to override the default for <tt>backgrnd</tt>,
we must also supply arguments for <tt>ht</tt> and <tt>wid</tt>:"
</li><li>Page 243:
Replace "parameter" at the end of the last bullet
by "argument in the call".
</li></ul>

<h2>Changes in exercises made in the second printing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Page 59:
Exercise 2.25 (a) should be 
<tt>int* ip, i, &amp;r = i;</tt>
</li><li> Page 228: Exercise 6.35 replace 
"<tt>fact</tt>" by 
"<tt>factorial</tt>".
</li><li> Page 250: Exercise 6.55 change "values" to "functions".
</li></ul>
